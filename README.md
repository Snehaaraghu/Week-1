# Week-1
The project aims on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of plastic waste into 2 different categories. The primary goal is to enhance waste management systems by improving the segregation and recycling process using deep learning technologies.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is hosted on Kaggle. You can download it from the following link:  
[Waste Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data/data)

After downloading, extract the files and place them in a folder named `dataset` at the root of the project directory.
